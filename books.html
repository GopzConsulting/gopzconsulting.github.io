<p>Here at Mojovation Consulting, we ðŸ’– reading, so much that we're publishing a new review of a particularly impactful book every Friday. These potted summaries will by no means capture every salient point from their respective titles, but if you find yourself hooked or intrigued, they come heartily recommended.</p>

<p>To learn about a title, click on its thumbnail or scroll down for the full list of books with descriptions.</p>
