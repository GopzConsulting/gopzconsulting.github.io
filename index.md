Here at **Mojovation Consulting**, we want to help agile software development teams to grow by nurturing their most valuable assets: their employees. As both teams and individuals, our needs and desires are often sidelined in favour of meeting project goals, achieving OKRs or keeping metrics happy. We're here to show you that all of those things are achievable, whilst also allowing people to showcase their authentic selves.

We offer **agile coaching**, **career advice** and **project consultancy** services to both individuals and organisations. Whether you're starting the first steps of your career, or you're a veteran who's stuck in a rut - we'd love to talk to you about how we can recapture that mojo together. ðŸš€
