**We're just getting started!** In the meantime, while we begin to flex our writing muscles, here's a little more about the Mojovation Consulting vision, our roadmap, and how we can help you.

### Who is behind Mojovation Consulting?

**Mojovation Consulting** is the brainchild of <a href="https://www.neilstudd.com">Neil Studd</a>, a software tester, engineer and manager with almost 20 years' experience of working with agile teams, helping them to deliver web, mobile and desktop solutions. Throughout this time, he has practiced an empathetic and humanist approach to building and leading teams, and working with senior managers to ensure that the needs of individuals are being met. He is a qualified Mental Health First Aider, and a budding author (who's hoping to convert much of the material on these pages into a published book by 2023).

### What is your mission?

Agile software development is undeniably a dynamic, exciting working environment. But when we're building teams and delivering projects, our focus tends to be on deliverables ("When can we ship it?") and metrics ("How can we deliver more work faster?")

What tends to get left by the wayside is the _people_ (so often referred to coldly as our "resources"). As we deliver sprint after sprint of work - or, when teams are stretched, sometimes asking people to split themselves across multiple teams simultaneously - the human cost is frequently ignored. Stress, exhaustion, burnout and depression are a constant risk factor, and yet team members constantly defer lunch breaks and holidays, as there's always "just one more critical thing" which needs to be completed first.

At **Mojovation Consulting**, we want to help individuals and organisations to excel at agile development, but to show care and respect for themselves and their colleagues along the way. By enabling people to be their authentic selves in the workplace, and to recognise and celebrate their diversity, you can ensure that your high-performing teams are also sustainable and flourishing.

### What services do you offer?

Maybe you're somebody who's trying to advance their career, or recapture the passion that made them set out on their career in the first place. Maybe you're a manager, team leader or executive who's trying to help their squads to find their identity. There are a variety of ways in which we can work with you to help with this: 

> **For organisations and teams:**
> * Presentations/workshops (online and in-person) on better agile working
> * Agile coaching and troubleshooting
> * Testing/QA strategies
> * Implementing test automation solutions
> 
> **For individuals:**
> * Career development roadmapping and mentoring 
> * Advice for your job search, including building the perfect CV 
> * Confidential discussions around mental health (MHFA certified)
> * Or let's just have a cuppa and talk through your workplace challenges!

If you're interested in how we might be able to work together, send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@mojovation.co.uk">hello@mojovation.co.uk</a> and we'll be happy to set up a free introductory call to learn more about your needs and how our service offering can help you.

### Why should I listen to you, rather than {Person X}?

Honestly, if Person X comes highly recommended, then you should definitely talk to them - the more voices, the better! What we're bringing to the table is two decades of experience of working on the coal-face of agile teams in a variety of roles, through various levels of seniority (including team lead, scrum-master and head of department), so our experience is more than just theoretical. To quote the classic Baz Luhrmann _Sunscreen_ song: "My advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience."

### Where did the name come from?

There's no dictionary definition for **mojovation** (although, surprisingly, there's an entry in the Urban Dictionary). However, self-evidently it's a blend of the terms "motivation" (a need/desire which gives us cause to act) and "mojo" (a magic spell, hex or charm). We all find our mystical spark from different sources - it might be a place, the people around us, or a sound or smell - and although we can practice motivational techniques with our teams, if that magical mojo is missing, you might not get the results that you're hoping for.

Stay tuned for a more detailed "What is Mojovation?" post, which will be coming shortly.

### What's with the terrible logo?

Honestly, our (very temporary) [logo](/assets/img/temporary_logo.png) is buried so deep that we were hoping nobody would notice it! Currently it only exists for the purposes of displaying a thumbnail when sharing our posts on social media. We're working on getting something more permanent designed as we grow 🌱
