ChatGPT and AI-driven content is on everyone's lips at the moment, and I've found some real successes in using it for technical content. While it's not specifically trained to generate code-related content in the same way that GitHub Copilot is, it's a particularly useful tool for refactoring (e.g. "identify how I can improve the performance of this code") and for creating boilerplate outlines in languages that you've not worked with before.

On the prose side, I'm yet to be fully convinced. I've seen examples of, for example, ChatGPT generating generic-looking cover letters to assist with job applications (which simultaneously look the part, whilst also saying nothing). But what about a business plan?

I spent a couple of months last summer constructing an outline for Mojovation Consulting, and the services that I could provide. It's time to find out whether that was wasted effort; could ChatGPT get me to the same place within 10 minutes?

### Given the definitions of the word "mojo" and "motivation", please provide me with a suggested definition for the word "mojovation".

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>"Mojovation" is a colloquial combination of the words "mojo" and "motivation," referring to a state of being in which an individual feels both a strong sense of confidence, energy, and enthusiasm (mojo) as well as a clear sense of purpose, drive, and determination (motivation) towards achieving their goals. Essentially, mojovation refers to a heightened state of both mental and physical readiness and determination that enables an individual to perform at their best and achieve their desired outcomes.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>Given that I practically coined the word myself, and there's not a lot of training data for it to specifically work with, that's a pretty adequate definition (it comes pretty close to [the version that I wrote]({% post_url 2022-07-14-what-is-mojovation %})). It's an obvious conclusion, given the two source words, but it's phrased in an easy-to-understand fashion.

### How might somebody improve their mojovation?

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>There are several strategies that an individual can use to improve their mojovation:
    <ol><li>Set Clear Goals: Having clear, specific, and achievable goals can provide a sense of direction and purpose, which in turn can increase motivation and help to build momentum.</li>
    <li>Find Inspiration: Seeking out inspiration from role models, mentors, or even just motivational quotes or stories can help to cultivate a positive mindset and increase motivation.</li>
    <li>Create Positive Habits: Establishing healthy habits such as regular exercise, meditation, or journaling can help to build momentum, reduce stress, and increase confidence, all of which can contribute to a stronger sense of mojovation.</li>
    <li>Celebrate Progress: Celebrating small wins along the way can help to build confidence and momentum, which can help to sustain motivation over time.</li>
    <li>Surround Yourself with Positivity: Surrounding oneself with positive, supportive people and environments can help to foster a sense of community and create a sense of accountability, both of which can help to sustain motivation and build mojovation.</li>
    <li>Take Breaks: Taking breaks and engaging in self-care activities such as spending time in nature, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in hobbies can help to reduce stress and increase energy levels, which can help to improve mojovation.</li></ol>
    Remember that everyone's journey towards improving mojovation is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's important to experiment with different strategies and find what works best for you.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>As you'll see with a lot of these answers, while ChatGPT will occasionally make passing callbacks to the word "mojovation", it's not really trained to understand the concept (even though it had just provided a definition). Instead, it slips into the habit of providing generic answers on how to improve motivation; this is potentially fine, and it may be that I should simply downplay my use of the word "mojovation" (and restrict it solely to the business name).

### How might a company called Mojovation Consulting be able to help its clients?

Time to ask ChatGPT to help me formulate a business plan, or at the very least, some marketing copy that I can use to help with selling my services.

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>Mojovation Consulting could help its clients in several ways, depending on the specific services they offer. Here are a few examples:
    <ol><li>Motivation and Performance Enhancement: Mojovation Consulting could work with clients to develop strategies and techniques to improve motivation, engagement, and performance within their organizations. This could include identifying areas of improvement, developing performance metrics, and providing training and coaching to managers and employees.</li>
    <li>Leadership Development: Mojovation Consulting could provide leadership development services to help clients develop the skills and qualities necessary to be effective leaders. This could include executive coaching, leadership assessments, and training programs designed to enhance leadership abilities.</li>
    <li>Organizational Culture Change: Mojovation Consulting could work with clients to assess their organizational culture and develop strategies to create a more positive, supportive, and engaging work environment. This could include developing and implementing programs to improve employee well-being, enhance team cohesion, and foster a culture of continuous improvement.</li>
    <li>Change Management: Mojovation Consulting could help clients manage major changes within their organizations, such as mergers, acquisitions, or restructuring. This could involve developing change management plans, providing training and support to employees, and helping to ensure a smooth transition.</li>
    <li>Team Building: Mojovation Consulting could provide team building and development services to help clients build high-performing teams that are aligned with their organizational goals. This could include team assessments, team-building activities, and training programs designed to enhance team communication, collaboration, and performance.</li></ol>
    Overall, Mojovation Consulting could help its clients improve their organizational effectiveness, enhance employee engagement and motivation, and achieve their goals by providing a range of consulting services and solutions.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>This is pretty much boilerplate stuff for anybody who's dealing with motivation in any domain. In hindsight, I wish I'd asked a follow-up to make it write something more specific to (for example) agile teams, but as you'll see in a later answer, as soon as I asked it to re-tailor the content then it became weirdly obsessed with the newly-provided keyword.

### Suggest titles for 5 blog posts which Mojovation Consulting could write, to help attract new clients.

It's time to get ChatGPT to suggest where I should guide my content next. I didn't specifically ask for SEO-friendly articles, but it appears to have put some thought into it:

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>Sure, here are five potential blog post titles for Mojovation Consulting:
    <ol><li>"The Power of Mojo: How to Unlock Your Team's Full Potential"<br/>
    This post could explore the concept of mojo and how it relates to employee motivation and performance. The article could offer tips and strategies for helping leaders and managers build a culture of mojovation within their organizations.</li>
    <li>"From Good to Great: Developing High-Performing Teams"<br/>
    This post could delve into the importance of teamwork and team-building within organizations. The article could offer insights and best practices for developing high-performing teams, including strategies for improving communication, enhancing collaboration, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.</li>
    <li>"The Leadership Edge: How to Develop Your Leadership Skills"<br/>
    This post could offer guidance and insights on how to become a more effective leader, with a focus on developing the skills and qualities necessary to inspire and motivate others. The article could offer tips and strategies for developing emotional intelligence, building trust, and leading with purpose.</li>
    <li>"Navigating Change: How to Successfully Manage Organizational Transitions"<br/>
    This post could explore the challenges of managing organizational change, and offer insights and best practices for successfully navigating major transitions. The article could cover topics such as change management planning, communication strategies, and employee engagement.</li>
    <li>"The Culture Factor: How to Build a Positive and Productive Organizational Culture"<br/>
    This post could focus on the importance of organizational culture, and offer strategies and insights for building a positive and productive work environment. The article could cover topics such as employee well-being, workplace diversity and inclusion, and building a culture of continuous learning and development.</li></ol></i></p>
</details>
<br/>They're very generic, but they're also very SEO-friendly. The titles aren't anything like the ones that I've used on the site up until now (again, perhaps I could have written a follow-up where I gave it a list of previous article titles, and it reworded them to fit my "style"). Still, content-wise, there are some good starting points within those suggestions.

### Suggest 20 single-word keywords which Mojovation Consulting could use in its meta tags, in order to drive more traffic via SEO.

SEO is a pet hate of mine, not least because it requires a lot of research and planning. I'm going to use ChatGPT to shortcut that for me, in the hope that it can produce something "broadly appropriate".

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>Sure, here are 20 potential single-word keywords that Mojovation Consulting could use in its meta tags:
    <ol><li>Mojo</li>
    <li>Motivation</li>
    <li>Performance</li>
    <li>Leadership</li>
    <li>Team-building</li>
    <li>Culture</li>
    <li>Engagement</li>
    <li>Well-being</li>
    <li>Change management</li>
    <li>Transformation</li>
    <li>Strategy</li>
    <li>Productivity</li>
    <li>Empowerment</li>
    <li>Growth</li>
    <li>Learning</li>
    <li>Coaching</li>
    <li>Communication</li>
    <li>Collaboration</li>
    <li>Innovation</li>
    <li>Excellence</li></ol>
    These keywords could be used in various combinations and permutations, depending on the specific content and focus of each page on the Mojovation Consulting website. It's worth noting that while meta tags can be useful for SEO, they are just one of many factors that search engines use to determine rankings, so it's important to focus on creating high-quality, relevant, and engaging content that will naturally attract traffic and backlinks.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>Yes, that'll absolutely do. It succeeds in allowing me to put roughly zero effort into something which is actually quite important, and it was nice that there was a cautionary paragraph about how SEO is more complex than simple meta keywords.

### Which tech conferences in the UK might be interested in hearing more about the power of mojovation?

I've pitched to a couple of conferences already; let's see where ChatGPT suggests that I focus my efforts.

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>There are several tech conferences in the UK that might be interested in hearing about the power of mojovation. Here are a few possibilities:
    <ol><li>London Tech Week: London Tech Week is a major technology event that attracts tens of thousands of attendees from around the world. The event features a wide range of speakers and sessions focused on technology and innovation, and could be a great platform for discussing the power of mojovation in the tech industry.</li>
    <li>Future Tech Now: Future Tech Now is a conference and exhibition that showcases the latest advancements in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and other emerging technologies. Mojovation Consulting could position itself as a thought leader on the intersection of technology and human performance, and discuss how mojovation can help unlock the full potential of technology.</li>
    <li>TechXLR8: TechXLR8 is a technology event that covers a wide range of topics, including artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and 5G. Mojovation Consulting could present on the importance of motivation and engagement in driving innovation and technological progress.</li>
    <li>Mind the Product: Mind the Product is a conference focused on product management and development. Mojovation Consulting could discuss how mojovation can help product teams stay motivated, engaged, and productive, and share insights and best practices for building a culture of mojovation within product organizations.</li>
    <li>Turing Fest: Turing Fest is an annual tech conference that brings together entrepreneurs, investors, and innovators from across the tech industry. Mojovation Consulting could present on the importance of motivation and performance in driving innovation and business success, and discuss strategies for creating a culture of mojovation within startup and entrepreneurial organizations.</li></ol>

These are just a few examples of the many tech conferences in the UK that could be interested in hearing about the power of mojovation. Ultimately, the key is to find events that align with Mojovation Consulting's mission and values, and that attract an audience that could benefit from its services and expertise.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>I slowed down to analyse this answer more carefully, as I've seen examples in the past of [ChatGPT making up fake citations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33841672). Do all of these events exist? Yes, although with some caveats that ChatGPT isn't trained to take account of. For instance, several of these events are happening imminently, with their programmes already fully announced. TechXLR8 hasn't run in the UK since 2017 (I'm not sure that ChatGPT really understands that I'm asking with a UK bias - it gives me an answer in dollars later). Future Tech Now and Turing Fest both seem like weird choices to pitch a motivation-themed session. Mind the Product, however, is a great suggestion, with an open Call for Papers: this is something that I'll actually follow up on. Thanks, ChatGPT!

### Suggest a title and format for a podcast which Mojovation Consulting could host. It should be both entertaining and informative, whilst also potentially driving new business.

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>Sure, here's a suggested title and format for a podcast that Mojovation Consulting could host:<br/><br/>
    Title: "Mojo Matters: Insights and Inspiration for High-Performing Teams"
    <br/><br/>
    Format: "Mojo Matters" would be a weekly podcast featuring lively discussions on a range of topics related to motivation, leadership, team-building, and organizational culture. Each episode could feature interviews with experts, thought leaders, and successful executives who have firsthand experience building and leading high-performing teams.
    <br/><br/>
    The format could vary from week to week, depending on the focus of the episode. Some episodes might feature in-depth interviews with guests, while others could be structured as roundtable discussions or debates. Each episode could also include actionable tips and insights for listeners who are looking to improve their own team's mojo.
    <br/><br/>
    Here are a few potential episode ideas:

    <ul><li>"The Mojo Mindset: How to Cultivate a Culture of Motivation and Engagement"</li>
    <li>"Leading with Purpose: Strategies for Inspiring and Motivating Your Team"</li>
    <li>"Beyond Ping Pong Tables: How to Build a Workplace Culture that Attracts and Retains Top Talent"</li>
    <li>"Breaking Down Barriers: Strategies for Improving Communication and Collaboration Across Teams"</li>
    <li>"Staying Ahead of the Curve: How to Foster a Culture of Innovation and Continuous Improvement"</li></ul>
    By hosting a podcast that offers valuable insights and entertaining discussions on topics related to motivation and performance, Mojovation Consulting could position itself as a thought leader and expert in its field. This could help drive new business by attracting potential clients who are seeking guidance on how to unlock their team's full potential and achieve better results.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>Podcasts are my bread and butter (both as a creator and a consumer), so I was interested to see what ChatGPT would offer here. I'll give it a B+: just like its blog post suggestions, these are extremely broad episode suggestions, but "Mojo Matters" isn't the worst podcast title in the world.

### Suggest 5 possible notable guests who I could invite to appear on the podcast.

Okay, let's get some more meat on those podcast bones. Who does ChatGPT think I should invite to appear on the podcast?

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>Sure, here are five possible notable guests that you could invite to appear on the "Mojo Matters" podcast:
    <ol><li>Simon Sinek: Simon Sinek is a well-known speaker, author, and leadership expert, who is perhaps best known for his TED Talk and book, "Start with Why." Sinek's insights on leadership, purpose, and motivation could be a valuable addition to the podcast, and his name recognition could help attract new listeners.</li>
    <li>Brene Brown: Brene Brown is a research professor and author who has become famous for her work on vulnerability, courage, and shame. Brown's insights on leadership, culture, and human behavior could be a valuable addition to the podcast, and her engaging speaking style could help keep listeners engaged.</li>
    <li>Daniel Pink: Daniel Pink is an author and speaker who has written several best-selling books on motivation, behavior, and the science of timing. Pink's insights on the importance of timing and motivation could be especially relevant to the themes of the podcast, and his engaging storytelling style could help make complex concepts more accessible.</li>
    <li>Susan Cain: Susan Cain is an author and speaker who has written extensively on the topic of introversion and the power of quiet. Cain's insights on how to cultivate a workplace culture that supports introverted team members could be a valuable addition to the podcast, and her unique perspective on leadership and teamwork could help spark interesting conversations.</li>
    <li>Malcolm Gladwell: Malcolm Gladwell is a journalist and author who has written several best-selling books on a wide range of topics, including motivation, culture, and the science of decision-making. Gladwell's insights on how to cultivate a culture of innovation and creativity could be a valuable addition to the podcast, and his engaging storytelling style could help keep listeners engaged.</li></ol></i></p>
</details>
<br/>I'll give ChatGPT points for ambition here - I've read all five authors, but the chances of securing any of them for a tiny little podcast are highly unlikely. Possibly my fault for asking for "notable guests"; it's clearly tailored its answers for notability.

### How much should I charge individuals for a 1-hour coaching session with Mojovation Consulting?

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>Determining the cost of a coaching session with Mojovation Consulting would depend on a variety of factors, such as the experience and qualifications of the coach, the specific services being offered, and the market demand for similar coaching services.
    <br/><br/>
    Some coaches charge a flat rate for a one-hour session, while others may charge an hourly rate or a package rate for a set number of sessions. According to the International Coach Federation (ICF), the global average rate for coaching sessions is around $250 per hour, but this can vary significantly based on the coach's experience, specialty, and location.
    <br/><br/>
    To determine the appropriate rate for your coaching services, you may want to consider conducting market research to determine what similar coaching services are being offered in your area and what rates they are charging. You may also want to consider your own qualifications and experience, as well as the value that you believe you can offer to your clients.
    <br/><br/>
    Ultimately, the price you charge for a one-hour coaching session with Mojovation Consulting should reflect the quality and value of the services you are providing, while also remaining competitive with other coaching services in your area. It's important to strike a balance between charging a fair price for your expertise and services and making your services accessible to potential clients.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>Given I don't really know the answers myself here either, I'm not surprised that ChatGPT is vague. The one actual price figure that it suggests (which is referenced from ICF, an organisation I'm familiar with) is reasonable, but beyond that, there's a lot of fluff and filler, as I'd expect due to a lack of specific parameters.

### If I wanted to write a book espousing the value of mojovation in building agile teams, what should I call it, and what should my chapters be titled?

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>If you wanted to write a book about the value of mojovation in building agile teams, you could consider the following book title and chapter titles:
    <br/><br/>
    Book Title: Agile Mojo: The Power of Motivation in Building High-Performing Teams<br/>
    Chapter 1: Introduction - Defining Agile Teams and the Importance of Mojo<br/>
    Chapter 2: Understanding the Science of Motivation and Its Impact on Team Performance<br/>
    Chapter 3: The Role of Leadership in Building and Maintaining Motivation in Agile Teams<br/>
    Chapter 4: Creating a Motivational Culture - Strategies for Fostering Engagement and Empowerment<br/>
    Chapter 5: Cultivating Team Mojo Through Goal-Setting, Feedback, and Recognition<br/>
    Chapter 6: Nurturing Resilience and Growth Mindset to Sustain Team Mojo<br/>
    Chapter 7: Dealing with Demotivation and Burnout - Strategies for Rekindling Mojo in Struggling Teams<br/>
    Chapter 8: The Future of Agile Teams and the Importance of Mojo in a Changing Landscape<br/>
    Chapter 9: Conclusion - Harnessing the Power of Mojo to Build Agile Teams that Thrive<br/>
    <br/>
    In addition to the above chapter titles, you could consider including case studies, practical tips, and exercises throughout the book to help readers apply the concepts and strategies to their own teams.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>Okay, by this point I was feeling a bit ChatGPT'd out. I'm starting to recognise some of its "tells": keyword-heavy, vague, and a bit repetitive. Does AI get bored? There's nothing inherently wrong with any of its suggestions, I just know that if I thumbed through a contents page, that sounds really bland.

### If I were to create a 1-day training course about better mojovation, can you break it down into 5 suggested modules (with content)?

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT's answer</summary>
    <br/><p><i>Sure, here are five suggested modules for a one-day training course on better mojovation, along with some potential content for each module:
    <br/><br/>
    Module 1: Understanding the Importance of Mojovation
    <ul><li>Defining mojovation and its impact on individual and team performance</li>
    <li>Reviewing the research on the connection between motivation, engagement, and productivity</li>
    <li>Identifying common barriers to mojovation and strategies for overcoming them</li></ul>

    Module 2: Building a Motivational Culture
    <ul><li>Examining the role of leadership in creating and maintaining a culture of motivation</li>
    <li>Identifying the key elements of a motivational culture, such as clear goals, feedback, recognition, and empowerment</li>
    <li>Developing strategies for fostering a motivational culture within your team or organization</li></ul>

    Module 3: Goal-Setting and Feedback
    <ul><li>Defining the principles of effective goal-setting and how they relate to motivation</li>
    <li>Understanding the importance of regular feedback in maintaining motivation and engagement</li>
    <li>Developing skills for providing constructive feedback that promotes growth and learning</li></ul>

    Module 4: Recognition and Rewards
    <ul><li>Understanding the psychology of rewards and recognition and their impact on motivation</li>
    <li>Identifying different types of rewards and recognition, and when to use each</li>
    <li>Developing strategies for creating a reward and recognition system that is effective and sustainable</li></ul>

    Module 5: Sustaining Motivation Over Time
    <ul><li>Examining the factors that contribute to sustained motivation and engagement over time</li>
    <li>Identifying common challenges to sustaining motivation, such as burnout and demotivation</li>
    <li>Developing strategies for fostering resilience and a growth mindset to maintain motivation and engagement over the long term</li></ul>
    Each module could include a combination of lectures, group discussions, case studies, and hands-on activities to engage participants and help them apply the concepts to their own work contexts. The training course could also include opportunities for participants to share their own experiences and learn from others in the group.</i></p>
</details>
<br/>OK, I'm beginning to accept that there are some things that I should just think about myself. ChatGPT lacks the context clues which are required to generate truly meaningful content, but it's very good at confidently doing an impression of something which _looks_ like meaningful content.

### In conclusion...

Generally, the smaller the task, the more adequately ChatGPT was able to perform the tasks that I asked for it. When I asked it to think more broadly, the answers were increasingly vague and potentially unappealing, which isn't brilliantly helpful when I want to use them to drive business.

What's undeniable is the speed at which it operates. There are questions in that list which I'd spent _hours_ musing over, without getting anywhere close to something that I felt was good enough to use. ChatGPT was able to spit out a response in a matter of seconds, and it was often a response that was better than anything I'd come up with.

The other fun part of this exercise is that I'm writing this blog post (and inserting ChatGPT's responses) in VS Code, where I've got GitHub Copilot enabled. Whenever I add one of ChatGPT's answers, Copilot is quick to suggest a follow-up question; I might try getting ChatGPT and Copilot to have a conversation with each other!

> **_Key takeaways_** 📝  
I fed the entire article above into ChatGPT, and asked it: **Given the article below, summarise its conclusions into three bullet-pointed key takeaways.** Here's what it said:
> * ChatGPT is useful for technical content, particularly for refactoring and creating boilerplate outlines in new languages. However, its effectiveness for prose is yet to be fully proven.
> * Mojovation Consulting is a company that deals with motivation in various domains, but ChatGPT struggles to understand the concept of "mojovation" specifically.
> * ChatGPT can generate SEO-friendly blog post titles and meta keywords for Mojovation Consulting, as well as suggest potential tech conferences and podcast titles/guests.
