The idea of people meeting daily from locations thousands of miles of away is most curious in it's ubiquity. Fifty years ago a long distance conference call could be hundreds of dollars.  I even found this old ad for Bell:

Imagine having an hour long virtual meeting where long distance attendees are paying in the neighborhood of $300.00 individually.  Today virtual communication like video chat comes at an incredibly small price compared to the value it provides. Similarly, the amount of productivity that can be fostered from the informed use of long distance contractors is staggering compared to the price.

Nevertheless, I see companies struggling to make the most of their remote dev teams and ultimately decide the (very low) price is too much. I've been managing remote and hybrid teams for over a decade now with minimal issue. Here are three things that have contributed to that success.

## Treat Remote Contractors With Respect

Should be an obvious one and yet I have seen many otherwise competent managers segment their hybrid teams into first and second class citizens based on location. Because people working on a contract basis are expected to be trained and managed outside the company hiring them, there is a tendency for managers in particular to assume that it's unnecessary or even harmful to involve them to the fullest extent possible. Even if a project is being done on a timeline of a month or two, a little goes a long way to foster a spirit of camaraderie amongst every walk of team member. Maybe that two month project turns into four months or perhaps another project comes down the chute that needs some extra hands. It costs very little to extend the same respect to remote workers as domestic ones and the rewards are great. 

## Know the Limitations

Not every task within a company is going to be a slam dunk for a remotely managed team. Detecting where the helpfulness of having a remote worker ends is important to making the most of their time. As an easy example, say there is a remote team hired to work on a specific project and let's also say that the process for getting that code deployed involves a lot of meetings during US working hours. In this case the ceremonies around the deployment of said code should be the responsibility of a domestic team lead or manager. I have found a few recurring indicators that certain tasks may not be suitable for a remote team of contractors:

Requires meeting attendance outside working hours in the country where the remote team is located - one thing I'll add here, because this seems like a no-brainer, is that it is important on the outset of a project to think about when meetings are likely to happen before the calendar fills up and it's too late. For instance, will this project require a lot of communication with key people who are strictly on US working hours?

Project has fluid/unknown scope - remote teams are best employed on projects that have tight scope (domestic teams too, but the reality is that scope cannot always be nailed down). Fluid scope basically translates to a higher rate of ongoing decision making between stakeholders, a difficult situation to be in for remote workers

Projects where other contracting companies are already involved - in my experience coordination between teams that hail from different contracting companies is difficult (although far from impossible).

## Don't Make Assumptions About Communication

Another common mistake when managing remote teams is that once given a high level directive the team will be able to execute on it without ongoing communication between them and their domestic counterparts. The feedback that comes from remote teams is invaluable, but often gets ignored. This gap usually stems from mistrus. Harmful assumptions are then formed around the quality of feedback that is being exchanged by both sides. Breaking these assumptions and investigating the sources of mistrust will dramatically improve efficiency while creating a more collaborative atmosphere between off shore and domestic contributors.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, augmenting domestic employees with remote staff, whether contracted or full time, can be extremely valuable. Oftentimes you can find high quality developers, QA engineers, project managers and more without sacrificing budget or flexibility. Nevertheless, a poorly managed remote team will only get you so far, to truly see them flourish requires a concentrated effort to employ their skills intelligently.
