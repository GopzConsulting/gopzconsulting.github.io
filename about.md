Thanks for visiting our site! We have [an FAQs post]({% post_url 2022-07-13-mojovation-consulting-who-what-and-why %}) if you'd like a bit of further background about how we came to be, but if you've arrived on this page, we're assuming you want to get straight to the juicy stuff.

### Service Offering

**For organisations and teams:**
* Presentations/workshops (online and in-person) on better agile working

If you're interested in discussing something that isn't listed above - we undoubtedly have an opinion on the matter (even if it's a recommendation for a better person to speak with) so please don't let that be a barrier to contacting us.

### Prices/Rates

While we're currently putting together our service plan, we're offering a limited number of **free sessions** on a first-come, first-served basis, to give us time to get to know each other, learn what makes us tick, and discover if we're compatible to work together in the way that you're hoping. We'll be giving priority sessions to graduates, job-seekers, or anybody else who's starting out on a tech career for the first time.

If you'd like to make a donation for our time, we'd be grateful for a small donation to [Neil's Ecologi profile](https://ecologi.com/neilstudd) (via the "Gift more impact" button). Currently, Neil has planted {{ site.data.ecologi.trees }} trees, and offset {{ site.data.ecologi.carbonOffset }} tonnes of carbon. ðŸŒ³

This is a short way of saying... Speak with us by completing the form below. We'll figure something out :)

### Testimonials

Here are a few kind words from people who've spoken with us recently:

* "I found an experienced, insightful, empathic, third-person perspective on motivations and problems."
* "I felt like you knew where I was coming from which was already a leg up on plenty of other conversations!"
