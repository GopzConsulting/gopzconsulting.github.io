Lovely fresh About content coming here soon.

In partnership with [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com/neilstudd), Neil has so far planted {{ site.data.ecologi.trees }} trees, and offset {{ site.data.ecologi.carbonOffset }} tonnes of carbon. (That's the equivalent of {{ site.data.ecologi.carbonOffset | divided_by: 1.3 | floor }} long-haul flights, or {% include ecologi-mileage-formatted.html %} miles driven in a car, or saving {{ site.data.ecologi.carbonOffset | times: 3 | round }}m<sup>2</sup> of sea ice.) ðŸŒ³
