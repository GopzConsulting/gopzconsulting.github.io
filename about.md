Founder, Ryan Collins, spent the past decade on the front lines of a rapidly changing tech landscape. 

As a senior manager at the world’s largest telemedicine company, Teladoc Health, he developed a knack for quickly understanding requirements and translating them into revenue drivers. Many of the more delicate operations currently powering Teladoc were implemented by his teams, including phone conferencing.

Prior to his time at Teladoc, Ryan spent several years working abroad in Spain and Ukraine. In Spain he helped hospital systems integrate medical imaging and case management technology in addition to learning conversational Spanish. In Ukraine he worked with contracting teams to support point of sale solutions for Clinique Skincare.

Ryan still enjoys writing code himself and seeing the finer details of solutions come to fruition. He loves seeing opportunities to employ the knowledge he gained in Boston University’s Computer Science program from which he graduated in 2014 with honors. He continues to be passionate about cryptocurrencies, machine learning and queuing theory.

Gopz Consulting Group was formed in early 2023 between Ryan and a small group of close collaborators. Since its inception the group has provided clients with affordable solutions for a wide variety of use cases.
