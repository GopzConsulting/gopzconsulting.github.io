### Notes to self

Config currently coded to the *Modernist* theme, with specific layout/assets overrides to support customisations of that theme.

If considering changing to another theme: for all that is holy, test it locally / on a branch before setting it all on fire...

### To run locally:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

### To view with draft posts:

Add `--drafts` to the above command
